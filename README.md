# SayBuilder 🎙️

SayBuilder is a work-in-progress **voice-driven web page builder**.  
The idea is simple: speak commands, and watch components appear in the page live.

## Features (so far)

- Voice input with the Web Speech API (toggle mic on/off).
- Component library panel to browse available UI blocks.
- Live preview of the page in an iframe.
- Properties panel to edit selected components.

## Planned

- Parse spoken commands like:
  - “Add button”
  - “Add header”
  - “Set title to Hello World”
- Build the web page live as you talk.
